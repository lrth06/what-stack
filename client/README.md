# CRA_Debloated

While building some tools and interfaces in [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), I found myself consistently stripping the standard template and building from almost scratch. This repository exists to streamline that process and give a good starting blank to React applications.

## To use in your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lrth06/cra-debloated.git
cd cra-debloated
yarn install
```
